- Hello, I’m Nathan and @intern8te is my business.
- I'll be using Git repos that strike my fancy or may be useful for my work 
- I’m interested in innovation in UX, sustainability, and education
- I’m currently learning business development, web development, and how to REST all the things more easily, would like to phase out Zapier etc with my own hooks in time.
- I’m looking to collaborate on useful tools that I can integrate into dynamic webpages and services for my clients
- Reach me at nathan@intern8te.com
